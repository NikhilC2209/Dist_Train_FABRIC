# SCALABLE DISTRIBUTED TRAINING WITH MODEL PARALLELISM IN FABRIC

## EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Run exp2_setup.ipynb for intra-operator model setup
Run esp3_setup.ipynb for inter-operator model setup

SSH into nodes and upload check_gpu.py to make sure node has multiple_GPU's

Then run single_gpu_train.py and multi_gpu_train.py for training and results
